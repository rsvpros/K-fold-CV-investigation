# K-fold-CV-investigation
Investigating K-fold-Cross-Validation techniques investigated by Jung 2007. A linear regression model will be used on heart-disease data and different K-fold cross validation techniques (including Multiple Predicting Cross Validation and different k values) will be tested and compared to Leave one out Cross Validation (LOOCV)
